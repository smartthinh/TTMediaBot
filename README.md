## ✨ Highlights of the Windows Edition

Compared to the original Linux/Docker implementation, this edition has been completely re-architected for Windows:

1. Pure Native Windows Architecture (Zero Docker / Zero Node.js):
   - Completely removes Docker containers, Linux shell scripts (*.sh), systemd services, and the external Node.js youtube_bridge daemon.
   - Runs directly on Windows with Python 3.10+, utilizing pre-bundled TeamTalk5.dll and mpv.dll dynamic libraries.
   - Powered by the Windows WASAPI audio backend (ao="wasapi"), delivering bit-perfect, jitter-free playback with ultra-low latency.
   - Features automatic in-memory patching (_disable_trial_dialog) in TeamTalkPy/TeamTalk5.py to eliminate blocking trial dialog popups during bot startup on Windows.
   - Built-in UTF-8 console output for international/Unicode titles and prioritized IPv4 DNS lookups to eliminate network resolution bottlenecks.

2. Live Synchronized Subtitles and Lyrics (sub, ly):
   - Streams live, synchronized subtitles and captions of YouTube videos directly onto the bot's status message in TeamTalk in real-time, just like YouTube closed captions.
   - Automatically supports official creator captions, YouTube automatic speech recognition (ASR) in multiple languages, and synced lyric fallbacks via syncedlyrics.
   - Fetches full synced lyrics on demand using the ly command across major providers (LRCLIB, Musixmatch, NetEase, Genius).

3. Intelligent Hybrid Song Recognition (ws):
   - Integrates a 3-tier hybrid recognition engine: YouTube Chapters -> Shazam -> Google Voice AI.
   - Accurately identifies both instrumentals without words (piano, guitar, lofi) and vocal songs (Bolero, pop, covers, live performances).
   - High-speed parallel concurrency architecture: extracts a single 10-second 16kHz mono WAV slice, queries Shazam and Google Speech simultaneously, and returns results in 3 to 5 seconds.

4. Studio-Grade Audio DSP Suite:
   - Musical Pitch Shift (pt): Shift playback pitch in real-time between -12 and +12 semitones using mpv's tuned Rubber Band v3 engine, preserving punchy drum transients and crystal-clear vocals.
   - Automated Silence Trimming (ts): Strips leading and trailing dead silence from streams to ensure seamless track transitions.

5. Seamless Audio Seeking and High-Performance Caching:
   - Built-in 128MB RAM demuxer cache with up to 3600 seconds of lookahead buffer prevents audio dropouts, stuttering, and pauses during forward and backward seeks (sf and sb).
   - Safe boundary seeking clamped within valid track duration, preventing track skipping or player stalls.

6. Self-Contained Direct yt-dlp Media Engine:
   - Resolves YouTube and YouTube Music streams directly via native Python yt-dlp without external background daemons.
   - Multi-track prefetching pipeline resolves both the upcoming track and the track after next for instant, buffer-free track skipping.
   - Retrieve permanent canonical YouTube URLs with the yl command (with optional TinyURL shortening).
   - Download complete playlists and albums as compressed ZIP archives to the channel via the dlp command.

## 🚀 Windows Installation Guide

### 1. Prerequisites
- Operating System: Windows 10, Windows 11, or Windows Server (64-bit).
- Python 3.10 or newer (Python 3.11, 3.12, or 3.13 64-bit recommended). Make sure to check "Add python.exe to PATH" during installation.
- TeamTalk 5 client installed on Windows (the bot automatically detects TeamTalk5.dll from C:\Program Files\TeamTalk5\ or the bot root folder).
- mpv.dll (shared C library for the MPV audio engine, setup in Step 2 below).

### 2. Setup Steps

#### Step 1: Clone or Download the Repository
Clone the repository with Git or download and extract the ZIP file:
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/smartthinh/TTMediaBot.git
cd TTMediaBot
```

#### Step 2: Download and Setup the MPV Library (mpv.dll)
Because the high-performance mpv.dll dynamic library exceeds 100MB, obtain the official Windows release directly:
1. Visit the official Windows releases page: https://github.com/shinchiro/mpv-winbuild-cmake/releases
2. In the Assets section of the latest release, search for and download the archive starting with:
   ```
   mpv-dev-x86_64-*.7z
   ```
   > Important note:
   > - Make sure the archive contains dev (mpv-dev-x86_64-...). Do not download standard player builds as they lack the C developer DLL.
   > - Avoid builds containing v3 (such as mpv-dev-x86_64-v3-...) if deploying to a VPS or older PC, as they require AVX2 instructions and will crash on virtual machine CPUs.
3. Extract the downloaded .7z archive using 7-Zip or WinRAR.
4. Inside the extracted folder, find libmpv-2.dll (or mpv-2.dll) and rename it to:
   ```
   mpv.dll
   ```
5. Copy mpv.dll and paste it into the root directory of the bot (TTMediaBot).

#### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Open Command Prompt (cmd) or PowerShell inside the bot directory and run:
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
(The static-ffmpeg package automatically manages FFmpeg binaries for Windows, so no manual system PATH configuration is required).

#### Step 4: Inspect Audio Devices
Run the following command in your terminal:
```cmd
python TTMediaBot.py --devices
```
This will print a numbered list of available Windows audio Input and Output devices along with their device IDs.

#### Step 5: Configure the Bot (config.json)
Open config.json with Notepad or your favorite editor and configure your server settings:
- teamtalk.hostname: TeamTalk 5 server address (e.g., tt5.example.com).
- teamtalk.tcp_port and udp_port: Connection ports (default: 10333).
- teamtalk.username and password: Bot account login credentials.
- teamtalk.nickname: Nickname displayed by the bot in channels.
- teamtalk.channel: Channel the bot joins on connect (e.g., / or /Music).
- teamtalk.users.admins: Array of TeamTalk usernames with administrator privileges (e.g., ["admin"]).
- sound_devices.output_device: Output device ID obtained from Step 4.
- sound_devices.input_device: Input device ID obtained from Step 4.

#### Step 6: Start the Bot
Run the following command:
```cmd
python TTMediaBot.py
```

## 🔧 Windows Troubleshooting and FAQ

### 1. Bot connects but there is no sound
- Verify your audio device settings: Run python TTMediaBot.py --devices to ensure the device IDs specified in config.json under sound_devices match your active Windows playback hardware.
- Test volume levels by sending v 80 to the bot.

### 2. Missing DLL or Module Error on Startup
- Re-run pip install -r requirements.txt in your command prompt.
- Confirm that TeamTalk5.dll and mpv.dll are located directly in the root directory alongside TTMediaBot.py. Refer to Step 2 above if you need to download and set up mpv.dll.

### 3. Running Multiple Bots Simultaneously on Windows
You can run multiple bot instances concurrently on a single Windows machine:
1. Make a copy of config.json (e.g., config_bot2.json).
2. Modify nickname (and username if separate accounts are needed on the TeamTalk server).
3. Open a second command prompt window and start the secondary bot:
   ```cmd
   python TTMediaBot.py -c config_bot2.json
   ```

### 4. Viewing Diagnostics and Logs
All execution logs, track resolution diagnostics, and song identification logs are recorded in:
```
TTMediaBot.log
```
located directly in the bot root directory.
